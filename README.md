# Bartender Flashcards

A React application to help users can customize drink elements and create flashcards for learning cocktails.

## Motivation

Transitioning from a wine and beer bartender to a cocktail bartender, there are many drinks and magnitudes more elements of those drinks—from glassware to liquor to garnish and more—that must be learned in order to serve guests with consistent quality and restaurant flow. Creating flashcards is a classic memory training exercise. I figured why just handwrite flashcards for myself and potentially re-write the same ingredient tens to hundreds of times when I could make an app that catalogues ingredients, details what they are and potentially include their history, and make them available instantly in creating flashcard drinks.
